<blockquote>
  <p>"Now we are getting much more insights into our funnels and it is a lot easier to use. Funnels helps us to increase our conversation rates just perfectly and we even save money with it. Thank you."</p></blockquote>


<p>Hi, this is Tom from Matomo. The creators of the web analytics platform which is used by over 1.4 million websites and apps in over 190 countries.</p>

<p>No matter what type of website or app you have, whether you are trying to get your users to sign up for something or sell products, there is a certain number of steps your visitors have to go through. I bet the same applies to you.</p>

<p><a href="#preview"><img src="https://www.innocraft.com/innocraft/funnels.png" style="width:320px;float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" alt="usersFlow.png" /></a>Have you ever wondered if your visitors or users actually follow that path in your website or app? And wondered where you lose your visitors? Where they maybe get confused? Want to see when something is not working anymore? Maybe you have a multi step signup form or onboarding process? On every step you lose visitors and therefore potential revenue and conversions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itâ€™s critical to know how well your visitors go through these steps, where they originally came from and where they go to when they drop off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are wondering about such things like we do, or want to drive your conversions and sales, we have something for you. Funnels visualizes the steps your users take to complete a goal or purchase to instantly see how well they succeed or fail at each step. When you have it, you can evaluate your success and improve your website or app to boost your conversion rates (CRO) and sales based on the information it provides. In one of our funnels we once noticed users often left our website because of unimportant links that were shown too eye-catching and suddenly we increased conversion rates by 10%, simply by removing a few links.</p>

<h3>Funnels helps you to increase your conversions, sales and revenue with your existing traffic by</h3>

<ul><li>finding out where your visitors have problems</li>
<li>finding out where they don\'t understand the flow of your website</li>
