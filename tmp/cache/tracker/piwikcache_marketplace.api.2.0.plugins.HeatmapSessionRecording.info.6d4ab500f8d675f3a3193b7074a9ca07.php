<p>Hi, this is Mike from Matomo, the creators of the web analytics platform which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p>I\'m very proud to introduce you to our Heatmap &amp; Session Recording feature which lets you analyze your visitors\' behaviour
on a whole new level that was not possible before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means it can increase your conversion rates and sales big times without much effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Heatmaps</strong> show you where on a page your visitors tried to click, where they moved the mouse and how far down they scrolled. This lets you find out to what your visitors really pay attention to, what they are looking for, how engaging your content is, whether
your content encourages users to scroll, whether key content is positioned correctly, whether they get distracted by something unimportant, whether your visitors think that something is clickable even though it is not, and much more. You can view heatmaps for different device types and compare how your content works across devices.</p>

<p><strong>Session Recordings</strong> lets you record activities such as clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, window resizes, form interactions, and changes in your page. You can then replay these activities in a video and see exactly what a visitor did on your website. It is like eye-tracking but much more cost effective, takes only seconds to setup, and you actually get insights into your real visitors instead of a test group. It is ideal to improve the usability of your website, to see how your visitors experience your website, where they have problems, and why they leave. A great use case is for example watching your visitors fill out forms and perfectly complements our <a href="https://www.form-analytics.net">Form Analytics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you have Heatmap &amp; Session Recording, you will see what your visitors see and do when they visit your website and ultimately truly understand them. Based on the insights you get, you will identify problems, make changes, and see if these changes actually improve your website.</p>
</blockquote>
