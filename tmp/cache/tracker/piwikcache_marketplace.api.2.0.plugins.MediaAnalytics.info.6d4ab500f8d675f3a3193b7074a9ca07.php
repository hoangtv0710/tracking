<p>Hi, this is Tom from Matomo, the creators of the web analytics platform which is used by over 1.4 million websites and apps in over 190 countries.</p>

<p>Over the past years we have spent a fortune and lots of our time on producing video and audio content for our websites 
and apps. But are they being watched? For how long? By whom? From where are they watching it? How do they affect our 
conversion rates and sales? Is it better when we place that video somewhere else or replace it with another one? 
Would another video perform better? When we added subtitles, did it change something? How are our video marketing campaigns doing? Can we justify the cost and time for producing them? If you have similar questions and unknowns, then we have built just the right tool for you.</p>
