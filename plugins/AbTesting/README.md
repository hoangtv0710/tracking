# Matomo A/B Testing & Experiments Plugin

## Description

Hi, this is Tom from Matomo, the creators of the web analytics platform which is used by over 1.4 million websites and apps in over 190 countries.

For years we had those discussions within our team and with the bosses about which solution would convert better than another. Sometimes they would be on a Monday morning even before the first coffee or on a Friday afternoon just before the weekend: “Let’s go with a red color here”, “No, I’m sure blue will work much better” and a third person comes in “I’m sure a lighter blue color is better”.

> Truth is, you never know what really works the best unless you test it.

Have you had similar situations? Do you want to consistently increase your conversions and revenue? Then we have built just the right thing for you and we are sure it will end your discussions too and help you grow your business. When you create an A/B Test, you compare different wordings, looks, layouts or entirely different pages with each other and you get scientifically proven results which version works better. No longer any guessing when you build your app or website.

> Take the guesswork out of your website optimization and reduce the risk in all your decision making.

Unsurprisingly - [A/B Testing](https://www.ab-tests.net) is one of the most requested feature for Matomo and since we built and started using it, it really made a difference and changed the way we work, think and make our decisions. Shall we use “Buy now” or “Subscribe now”? Which background or product image works better? Now we simply try different versions, test them and keep the best working solution that actually increases our conversions. We even review previously made decisions and we got some shocking results: we were sometimes very wrong about what converts best. Did you know that in some tests changing a button color from green to red increased clicks by over 20%? I’d be curious to hear about your remarkable changes once you start testing.

> Start testing and improving everything from aesthetics like content and colors to back-end functionality. Even small changes can have a huge impact in your conversions and revenue.

A/B Testing is built on top of Matomo which means you get all those benefits and features from Matomo on top. Like data ownership, no data limits, being able to host it yourself on premise and use it in the intranet etc. That’s why Matomo is so popular among businesses, corporations and governments. Matomo is used and trusted by over a million websites and apps.

### How it works

When you have the [A/B Testing plugin](https://www.ab-tests.net), it lets you easily create experiments and compare different versions of your website or app and it will automatically detect which variation increases your revenue or conversions. 

> Experimenting and measuring the effect of each change you make with A/B testing gives you the confidence to always make changes which increase your revenue and conversions.

users (visitors) and the variation that performs better wins. When a user enters the experiment, a variation will be 
randomly chosen and the user will see this variation for all subsequent visits. Matomo A/B testing uses 
advanced statistical analysis to detect which variation performs better for your conversion goals and success metrics.

> Ultimately you can eliminate the guess work in your decision making and maximise your success!
