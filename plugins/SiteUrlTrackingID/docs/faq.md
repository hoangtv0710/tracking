## FAQ

__Are there any settings?__

No. Once the plugin is activated, it starts to do its job.

__Is it going to break my existing tracking codes?__

No. Piwik will continue to work as normal with the numeric site IDs in the tracking requests.

__I have a website with two additional URLs, can I use those as well?__

Yes. Piwik will generate the tracking code with only the main URL. However you may modify the tracking code to use any of the site URLs of a website.

__Can I use variations of a site URL in the tracking code?__

You may use any of the site URLs of a website, as long as they are defined in the website configuration. If there are additional variations, please add them to your configuration first before modifying the tracking code.
