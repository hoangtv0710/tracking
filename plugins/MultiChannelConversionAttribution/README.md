# Matomo MultiChannelConversionAttribution Plugin

## Description

Hi, this is Mike from Matomo, the creators of the web analytics platform which is used by over 1.4 million websites and apps in over 190 countries.

When you acquire visitors, one of the most challenging question is to know on which channels to spend your money
 and how much. One of the most important sources for this kind of information is to measure which channels or referrers
 are the most successful and lead the most to your goal conversions and Ecommerce sales compared to your spending. 
  
The problem is that most analytics tools, including Matomo, only show you the channels for the last non-direct visits. However, in reality, multiple channels contribute to a conversion as a visitor often visits a website several times from different channels before they convert a goal. This means having only a look at the last visit doesn't give you an accurate representation of the most successful channels.
 
The Multi Channel Conversion Attribution gives you a better understanding of your media spending by letting you apply 
different attribution models to find out which channels really lead to a conversion or purchase. You can compare the 
different models next to each other and see how you need to shift your spending from one channel, ad, or campaign to another.
