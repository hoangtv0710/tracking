# Matomo Cohorts Analysis Plugin

_Track your visitor retention rates, then keep your visitors engaged and coming back._

## Description

Hi, this is Tom from Matomo, the creators of the web analytics platform which is used by over 1.4 million websites and apps in over 190 countries.

> No matter what type of website you run, you'll want your visitors coming back for more.

What's the point of a news site that never gets its readers to read another article again? Or a store where average customer lifetime value can be measured in a single purchase? Or an app whose users quit a week after downloading it?

We want our readers, customers and users to stick around, because the longer they do that, the more money we'll make and the more impact we have.
No matter the business, success is directly tied to how long we can keep our visitors coming back for more.

> So, it’s important to know how well you retain users over time

Out of the box Matomo will display your overall returning visitors count and allows you to see each available report for returning visitors.
You can use these basic reports to answer questions like "What percent of my visitors come back?" or "What pages do my returning visitors view?".

Alone, this can be a useful tool to understand what keeps your visitors engaged, but it lacks the depth of understanding that Cohorts Analysis provides.

With the Cohorts plugin, you'll be able to answer questions like:

* How long do new readers stick around before dropping off? Is there a specific time period after joining our news site where engagement drops?
* Some of the visitors to our ecommerce store visit many times, but never purchase. How are they different from those who visit many times, but ultimately make a purchase?
* Many of our users appear to stop using our app after a couple of weeks, while some stop the day after downloading it. Are these segments different? Do they experience certain problems that some users simply put up with while others give up on immediately?
* Last week, we added a tour of our app to help new users figure out what to do. Are our users sticking around longer now? If so, by how many days?

Just by looking at these questions, I'm sure you can see how actionable this type of analysis can be, and I'm sure you've thought of some questions of your own you'd like answered.

> Increasing your retention rates will have a direct effect on your bottom line and the Cohorts plugin provides you with a powerful tool to achieve that outcome.
