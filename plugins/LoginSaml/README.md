# Matomo LoginSaml Plugin

## Description

This Matomo authentication plugin allows users to log in to Matomo using SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

If you have a federated environment with a SAML Identity Provider (OneLogin, Okta, Ping Identity, ADFS, Google, Salesforce, SharePoint...), you can use this plugin to interoperate with it, thereby enabling SSO for your Matomo users.

SSO with SAML for Matomo offers many benefits. It can ensure consistent access control across the enterprise and external providers, potentially reducing support costs related to authentication / accounts management.
